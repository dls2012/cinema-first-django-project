This is the first time I'm deploying web-site or the whole site itself, just for experiement hope I will build more advanced ones in the future. This, was the site in russian cause I'm kinda comfortable using this
language. This site in the overall, is well built if we conisder it's my first time building web applications. Contains several pages for user authentication, editing profile, profile, editing movies(only for admin),
comments section, trailer for a movies and the changing this comment or the account only by the user who is the author of that comment. These and more other security levels have been added to the web-site, for example
users who are not authenticated will not be eligible to write the comments or see the edit the profile and cinema.
